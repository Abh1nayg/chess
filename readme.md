Implementation of chess in python created mainly by following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial by Eddie Sharick, with stockfish suggested moves, interactive ui, as well as displaying the PGN in the terminal after each match.

PS: This is the latest version of stockfish that I've downloaded from (https://stockfishchess.org/).
